# nixos-files
files for my nixos-installation. DO NOT USE WORK IN PROGRESS!

BTW If you for some reason use this at this point. Use your own hardware configuration, bc this hardware configuration is for virtualbox so this would break your installation if you use it.

If you want to change your username. Change it in flake.nix and in configuration.nix

To make wlogout (and maybe other programs in the future work) put your nixos-files in your home folder so ~/nixos-files
